# Wrapper Class for implementing stateful LSTM models in Keras
The wrapper class was designed for personal use and is thus tailored for LSTM models. It is aimed at easily implementing stateful LSTMs in Keras and includes functions that replicate fitting, grid search (unfinished/in progress), early stopping, etc. functionalities provided by Keras for stateless models.
